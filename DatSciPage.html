          <h3 class="pro-description indented">
              For hotel operations to thrive, swift and informed decisions are paramount. 
              However, critical data points such as real-time occupancy, projected arrivals, 
              out-of-order room availability, and variable room pricing were often fragmented 
              and difficult to access in a coherent format. This presented a significant challenge: 
              how to synthesize these dynamic metrics, track their evolution over time, 
              and visualize their interdependencies to empower effective decision-making? 
              The absence of a readily accessible, visual overview meant that opportunities for optimizing room pricing, 
              and maximizing overall revenue might be overlooked due to data being siloed and difficult to interpret 
              as various numbers only tables.
          </h3>
          <h3 class="pro-description">Solution:</h3>
          <h3 class="pro-description indented">
              To streamline the analysis of critical hotel performance indicators, 
              I engineered an automated data analysis and visualization dashboard within Google Sheets. 
              This robust solution was designed to efficiently parse disparate raw data sources for hotel occupancy, 
              arrivals, out-of-order rooms, and pricing, and then aggregate these metrics dynamically. 
              The core of this solution lies in its ability to present complex, time-series data in clear, 
              digestible visualizations that update automatically. This drastically reduced the manual effort 
              and potential for error, providing management with a high-fidelity, real-time overview of operational health. 
              The result is a powerful tool that enables proactive adjustments to pricing, optimized resource allocation, 
              and a deeper, ongoing understanding of the hotel's evolving financial and operational landscape.

          <h3 class="pro-description indented">In our lab, we collected a variety of behavioral data 
            from experimental subjects across four distinct groups. The challenge was that this data 
            required extensive reformatting before it can be transferred to statistical analysis 
            software for group-by-group testing and graphing. This manual reformatting process was 
            not only time-consuming but also susceptible to human error. Moreover, the statistical 
            software used generated basic and aesthetically unappealing graphs, which limited the 
            quality of data visualization.

          <h3 class="pro-description indented">To overcome the inefficiencies and error-prone nature 
            of manual data reformatting, a PySimpleGUI desktop application was created, tailored

            boasts a user-friendly graphical interface, enabling lab members to quickly extract 
            relevant data, conduct group-by-group analyses, and generate comparative graphs with 
            minimal effort. This solution allows users to perform these tasks with a few clicks, 
            delivering analyzed results and high-quality visualizations of group differences within 
            seconds, thereby streamlining the workflow and improving the quality of data representation.

            <h3 class="pro-description">Problem:</h3>
            <h3 class="pro-description indented">In experiments involving pair-housed subjects that 
              undergo an initial baseline test and based on this baseline data are assigned to subsequent groups,
              the challenge lies in assigning them to two groups (control vs treatment) with 
              minimal initial differences between groups. However, doing so ensures that any biases from 
              previous conditions do not influence the outcomes of subsequent experiments. 
              Moreover, it's crucial to maintain cage mates within the same group to prevent 
              potential cross-group effects—if one subject experiences stress due to its 
              group's treatment, it could impact the results of its paired partner in future 
              tests. Compounding this challenge of identifying the two groups that exhibit the 
              absolute least differences, is the fact that the task could  potentially involve 
              analyzing and comparing hundreds, if not thousands, of group assignment 
              possibilities. Such extensive analysis would be impractical for a human to 
              perform manually. 
            <h3 class="pro-description">Solution:</h3>
            <h3 class="pro-description indented"> 
              A PySimpleGUI desktop application was developed to analyze individual 
              data from cage mate pairs stored in an Excel file. The application systematically evaluates every possible 
              combination of group assignments to identify the combination where the 
              data points exhibit the least overall difference while preserving 
              their pairing. This analysis 
              includes calculating and recording various metrics in an Excel 
              output file, such as: 
              <ol>
                <li class="rh-list">All possible group combinations considered</li>
                <li class="rh-list">The means of all possible group combinations</li>
                <li class="rh-list">The absolute differences between data points 
                                    across all group combinations</li>
                <li class="rh-list">The specific group assignments resulting in 
                                    the smallest mean difference between groups</li>
              </ol>
              The program also displays a graphical representation of the group assignments using Matplotlib. 
              The line plot depicts the data points of the least 
              different group assignments, while also maintaining 
              adherence to cage mate pairing. These lines are plotted to visually 
              illustrate the minimal possible distance between data points.
              The application’s output provides a comprehensive overview of the 
              analysis steps and results, facilitating informed decision-making 
              for optimal group assignment in experimental setups.

                <h3 class="pro-description indented">
                  In studies investigating the effects of exercise using a running wheel, 
                  our lab used a program that tracked total revolutions every minute. 
                  This data was logged into an Excel worksheet each minute over a 24-hour 
                  cycle creating one sheet per subject for each 24-hour cycle. For many 
                  subjects over extended periods, this generates millions of data points. 
                  The analytical challenge included counting only valid running bouts 
                  (≥3 revolutions per minute) and distinguishing running behaviors between 
                  the light (inactive) and dark (active) phases of the subject’s light cycle. 
                  The goal was to efficiently process and analyze this extensive dataset to 
                  quantify various aspects of running behavior while considering phase-specific 
                  activity patterns, providing meaningful insights into the effects of exercise.

                <h3 class="pro-description">Solution:</h3>
                <h3 class="pro-description indented">
                  To address the data management challenges posed by these running wheel experiments, 
                  a user-friendly graphical interface program was developed. This program compiles 
                  and organizes the raw data from Excel files into a ‘Combined Data’ sheet alongside 
                  the original data sheets, categorizing running behaviors and distinguishing them by 
                  the subjects’ inactive (light) and active (dark) phases. Automating data calculation 
                  and aggregation significantly reduced the manual workload and minimizes errors, 
                  accomplishing in seconds what would otherwise have taken hours. Additionally, the program 
                  features a bar graph visualization tool, providing users with a quick and 
                  informative visual analysis of the dataset.

                <h3 class="pro-description indented">Credit card companies and 
                  banks typically offer basic charts that group spending into 
                  broad categories. While useful for a general overview, these 
                  charts fail to monitor spending trends over time and frequently 
                  miscategorized transactions, leading to inaccuracies. These 
                  inaccuracies can mislead users, affecting their ability to make 
                  informed financial decisions and plan budgets effectively. 
                  A more personalized and precise system that accurately 
                  categorizes spending and tracks detailed spending patterns over 
                  time, provides more reliable data analysis to support financial planning.

                  Matplotlib, such as stacked bar graphs, to present monthly 
                  spending across specific categories. This approach provides 
                  clear, detailed insights into financial activity, facilitating 
                  better tracking and analysis of expenditures.

                <h3 class="pro-description indented">In our lab, we quantified 
                  and analyzed the locomotion activity of experimental test 
                  subjects using an activity tracking chamber. This chamber 
                  records the subjects’ movements via infrared beam breaks 
                  and the software outputs comprehensive data in a .txt file 
                  across various categories. However, our analysis required 
                  only specific portions of this data. The large amount of 
                  superfluous data in text format made locating
                  extracting, and transferring the relevant data into a 
                  formatted Excel spreadsheet for statistical analysis is a 
                  manual, labor-intensive task that consumed significant time. 
                  The process was not only inefficient, but  prone to errors, 
                  especially with large datasets from 
                  multiple subjects over extended experimental trials. 
                <h3 class="pro-description">Solution:</h3>
                <h3 class="pro-description indented"> 
                  To address the inefficiencies in handling locomotion activity 
                  data, a desktop application was developed with a user-friendly 
                  interface that automates the data processing workflow. 
                  The application transforms the raw .txt file into a 
                  standardized format, selectively extracts the relevant data 
                  categories required for analysis, and transfers this data 
                  into a properly formatted Excel spreadsheet. This automation 
                  reduces the processing time from hours to seconds and eliminates 
                  the risk of human errors associated with manual data handling. 
                  In addition to data handling, the program allows the user to output 
                  a bar graph of activity data over time for rapid analysis and anomaly detection.
