            <div class="details hidden">
              Our laboratory wanted to design a new animal behavioral experiment. 
              This required using animal behavior recording chambers, which necessitated learning and 
              mastering the MedStateCode programming language independently. Overcoming this challenge is 
              when I initially discovered the power of coding and programming.

            <div class="details hidden">
              Empowered by my initial success with programming, I decided to learn the versatile Python language. 
              Eager to apply this tool, I explored how it could advance our scientific goals. Before long, 
              I was providing solutions to previously intractable problems.

            <div class="details hidden">
              Wanting to share these solutions presented the challenge of enabling colleagues to use these 
              programs for their projects. This led me to learn how to construct and design GUI applications. 
              My efforts culminated in creating many PySimpleGUI and Tkinter standalone executable programs, 
              complete with intuitive user interfaces for non-technical lab members.

            <div class="details hidden">
              Recognizing Python's potential for task automation, I set out to address the tedious data collection and 
              entry issues plaguing our data-dependent lab. This led to the creation of numerous automation programs, 
              saving countless hours of data aggregation and processing time.

            <div class="details hidden">
              In an effort to provide mobile solutions for lab members, I tackled a new challenge. 
              Many routine lab tasks require precise calculations and are prone to errors, 
              such as drug dosing or converting between different chemical solution percentages. 
              To address these issues, I created sharable mobile applications using the Kivy framework, 
              allowing lab members to perform these calculations in the field, ensuring speedy and accurate results.

            <div class="details hidden">
              Although automating data collection and calculations saved much time, 
              there was another side of Python uniquely suited to scientific endeavors: 
              statistical analysis and data visualization. To harness Python's strength in this realm, 
              I began learning critical frameworks such as Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib. 
              As I became proficient in data manipulation and visualization, 
              I unlocked new insights and efficiencies for our lab.

            <div class="details hidden">
              While my initial Python learning was self-directed, 
              I recognized the value of structured learning and formal recognition. 
              I began supplementing my independent study with online courses and 
              pursuing relevant certifications to solidify my knowledge and demonstrate my skills. 
              This included learning from platforms like FreeCodeCamp, Codecademy, and Coursera.

              Expanding my data science skill set, I've continued learning visualization tools 
              such as Tableau, Streamlit, and R. Additionally, 
              I've begun exploring machine learning theory and building prediction models.
