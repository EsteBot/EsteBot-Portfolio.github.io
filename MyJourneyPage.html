    <div class="content">Coding Introduction with MedState Code</div>
    <div class="details">Our laboratory wanted to design a new animal behavioral experiment.
                        However, this required the programming of operant conditioning chambers
                        written in a programming language that I had to learn and master on my own.
                        Overcoming this challenge is when I initially discovered the power of 
                        coding and programming.</div>

    <div class="details">Realizing Python's versatile applications in the scientific field and 
                        its ability to automate tasks, I decided to try and solve the problems
                        of tedious data collection and entry that plague most data dependent laboratories.
                        This resulted in the creation of numerous programs that saved countless hours
                        of data aggregation and processing time.</div>

    <div class="details">Wanting to share these solutions, presented the next challenge of how to empower
                        colleagues so that they too might use these programs for their projects. This is when I began 
                        learning how to construct and design GUI applications. These efforts culminated in the creation of many 
                        standalone executable and sharable data processing files with user interfaces for non-technical
                        lab members.</div>

    <div class="content">Built More Complex Tkinter GUI Projects</div>
    <div class="details">With more experience in UX design and logical operations, I set to design
                        increasingly complex GUI applications using the Tkinter Python framework. I created
                        applications with multiple tabs with independent functionality. I also created
                        a multi-behavior timer to be used by team memebers for data collection and analysis.

                    There are many tasks in the lab that require correct calculations, that are routine, yet
                    prone to error. For example, drug dosing calculations or converting between different
                    chemical solution percents. To solve these problems, I created sharable mobile applications
                    so lab members could solve these on-the-spot right on their phones to ensure speedy calculation accuracy.
