          <h3 class="pro-description indented">
            Behavioral neuroscience research depends heavily on accurately quantifying 
            the frequency and duration of specific behaviors. Often, these are single 
            behaviors selected based on their importance in contributing to the 
            understanding of underlying mechanisms, relationships, or phenomena being 
            investigated. Therefore, this behavior needs to be meticulously segmented 
            into individual occurrences. This task often requires the input of 
            multiple observers to ensure unbiased results. Moreover, experiments 
            often involve testing numerous subjects over extended periods, making it 
            essential to have a straightforward and reliable method for robust behavior 
            quantification. To maximize efficiency, it’s ideal that the resulting data 
            is readily available in a format suitable for detailed analysis.

          <h3 class="pro-description indented">
            A Python-based mobile application using the Kivy framework was developed to 
            streamline behavioral data collection for scientific research. 
            The application allows users to input experiment details into specified fields that, 
            once the session data is saved, gets transferred into an Excel document dedicated to 
            storing behavior data in a format that streamlines subsequent data analysis. 
            The experimental observer depresses a main button on the app's interface to record 
            behavior instances and their durations when subjects engage in the specified behavior.
            Key features of the application include:

            In laboratory environments, creating and adjusting chemical solutions is a 
            frequent and essential task. This process presents significant challenges 
            for new lab members who must learn various preparation methods,

            Accurate drug dosing is essential in experimental research involving animal subjects, 
            especially in studies that rely on precise drug formulations. 
            Our laboratory frequently trained students new to scientific research 
            and animal models of neurobiology. A significant hurdle they faced was 
            converting between units of measurement: animals were weighed in grams, 
            whereas drugs were measured in grams, yet dosing calculations must be expressed 
            in milligrams of drug per kilogram of animal body weight. 
            These unit conversions posed a challenge, often leading to confusion and errors 
            among novice scientists, which can compromise the accuracy and reliability of 
            dosing in experimental protocols. To enhance accessibility and mitigate these challenges, 
            there was a compelling need for a mobile application that could provide a solution to these 
            challenges. Such an application would enable users to perform precise dosing calculations 
            conveniently and promptly anywhere in the laboratory, ensuring consistent and reliable dosing 
            practices.

            To address challenges associated with unit conversions and 
            calculation errors in drug dosing, a Python-based Kivy application 
            was designed. This application features two distinct calculation 
            functionalities, each accessible through complementary, user-friendly tabs, aimed 
            at simplifying drug formulation tasks:

                The application swiftly computes the precise amount of drug 
                needed in both grams and milligrams, alongside displaying the 
                maximum subject gram weight the formulation will support.</li>
              <li>Volume Calculation: This tab allows users to input the 
                combined weight of animals slated to receive the drug and 
                the targeted mg/kg dose. The application instantly calculates 
                the exact quantity of drug in grams and milligrams required 
                for the dosage, as well as the corresponding required volume 
                of solution in milliliters.</li>

            By automating these calculations, the application equips novice 
            scientists with a reliable toolset to execute dosing procedures 
            accurately and efficiently. Its mobile compatibility further 
            ensures accessibility wherever and whenever needed, supporting 
            seamless integration into daily laboratory workflows.

                (lateral/medial), and forward and backward (anterior/posterior). 
                Each arm has scales for fine measurements.</li>
              <li>The adjustable arms hold surgical tools or instruments, 
                allowing scientists to accurately position them in the animal's

          <h3 class="pro-description">What It's Used For:</h3>
          <h3 class="pro-description indented">
            Scientists use the stereotaxic device to implant electrodes, 
            inject substances, or perform other delicate procedures on small, 
            precise locations in the animal. This can help in studying brain 
            functions, testing new treatments, or understanding diseases.

          <h3 class="pro-description">Coordinate Calculations:</h3>
          <h3 class="pro-description indented">
            When doing stereotaxic brain surgery, the operator bases the 
            position of their targets from a location on the skull known 
            as bregma. Bregma is referenced in three-dimensional space by 
            the three variables DV (dorsal/ventral), LM (lateral/medial), 
            AP (anterior/posterior). For each of these variables there is 
            a distance from their bregma location that is calculated to position 
            an apparatus at a desired location in the brain. These calculations 
            were most often performed in a lab notebook and using a basic 
            calculator. This method introduces the possibility of human error, 
            is slow, might be illegible to other lab members and can be variable in 
            how values are formatted between individuals increasing confusion if 
            referenced by other lab members.
          </h3>
          <h3 class="pro-description">Solution:</h3>
          <h3 class="pro-description indented">
            A Python Kivy mobile app was created to assist in correct coordinate 
            calculations when performing stereotaxic brain surgery on rodents. 
            The application has three tabs, the tab chosen being based on the 
            number of stereotaxic targets the operator is aiming for. 
            The Unilateral tab is for a single target, the Bilateral tab is 
            for two targets, each equidistant and on either side of the brain, 
            the third tab is useful for two bilateral targets having four 
            calculated targets total. The app takes the initial bregma variables 
            as well as their respective distance variables and performs their 
            calculations to display the color-coded target values to the user. 
            The target values are then simply dialed into the stereotaxic frame.
            This eliminates hand calculation time as well as human error. 
            The app has several additional fields to facilitate record keeping. 
            These are ‘Subject’, ‘Experiment’, ‘Operator’, ‘Weight’, ‘Region’, 
            ‘Date’, there is also a ‘Reset’ button for the quick start of the next 
            subject or input errors.  The app introduces the capability to export 
            the calculation image to integrate data seamlessly into lab databases or experimental records. 
            Since the input values are uniformly formatted, color coded and not 
            individually written in different lab notebooks, the records can be 
            accessed and understood by all lab members from anywhere the lab’s 
            file system can be accessed.
