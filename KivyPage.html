        <h3 class="pro-description">A Python based Kivy UI mobile application 
          designed for the recording and preliminary analysis of any timed, single 
          animal behavior. The application has a field for the user to enter a 
          file name for the Excel sheet that will store the recorded and calculated 
          data. Additional fields for the Excel output sheet include Experiment ID, 
          Observer ID, and Subjects ID. A stopwatch style timer is also available to 
          track the progress and duration of the experimental trial. This timer can 
          be used to enter and reset the time for each subsequent subject’s 
          experimental trial. Under each Subject ID is a large ‘Press While Recording 
          Behavior’ button. The app will record the total time the button is 
          depressed (total behavior time) along with how many times the button was 
          pressed (number of behavior bouts). The screen will display these values 
          along with the last recorded bout time length for verification. Once the 
          experimental trial has concluded and all data is ready to be recorded, 
          there is a ‘Unlock Submit Button’ (created to prevent unintentional 
          submission of data) button that enables the ‘Submit Trial Data’ button 
          that exports all data to the previously created Excel file. After 
          submitting data, a box displaying the subject ID of the last trial 
          saved is displayed for verification. Within the Excel file, exported behavior measures are 
          divided into several categories. One tab has a summary of each subject’s 
          total behavior time and number of bouts. The next tab has a breakdown of 
          all the lengths of all subjects’ individual bouts. Depending on the 
          experimental parameters the user can simply send the Excel file to a 
          lab member and run the output data through the laboratory’s preferred 
          statistical testing software.</h3>

          <h3 class="pro-description">A Python based Kivy UI mobile application 
            for the calculation and creation of common laboratory solutions. 
            The app has three tabs, one that performs the M1*V1 = M2*V2 
            calculation in which the user enters in any three known variables 
            of the equation. Pressing the ‘Calculate Missing Value’ button, 
            the app calculates and displays the unknown variable along with 
            the calculation used to arrive at that variables’ value. Another 
            tab performs a two-part ratio calculation. This app contains three 
            fields in which the user enters the desired final solution volume 
            and the two ratios that the user wants the final solution to be 
            composed of. By pressing the ‘Calculate Ratio Amounts’ button, 
            the app will calculate and display how the calculation was performed 
            as well as the volume amounts of the two solutions to be mixed to 
            obtain the correct final volume. Another tab contains an app for 
            calculating the dry weight in grams of compound required to create 
            a certain percent solution of that compound. The UI has two input 
            fields where the user enters the desired percent solution to be 
            created and the final volume of the solution. Upon pressing 
            the ‘Calculate Grams Needed’ button, the app will calculate and 
            display the necessary weight in grams of dry compound needed

          <h3 class="pro-description">Python based Kivy mobile app that has two 
            complementary functions being on two tabs. In general, the application 
            is to assist in the accurate creation of correct solution concentrations 
            when making solutions for systemic injections of drug volumes based on 
            a Mg/Kg dose. The first tab has two input fields. The first is to input 
            the desired Mg/Kg dose. The second is to input the needed final volume 
            of that dose. Upon pressing the ‘Calculate Weights’ button, three 
            outputs will be rendered to the screen. 1. ‘Dosable Weight (g)’ which is 
            the maximum grams of subject weight that this amount of solution will 
            be appropriate for. 2. ‘Drug Weight (Mg)’ being the amount of dry 
            chemical needed to be weighed out in milligrams. 3. ‘Drug Weight (g)’ 
            being the amount of dry chemical needed to be weighed out in grams. 
            There is also a ‘Reset’ button that will clear all fields for further 
            calculations or in the case of input errors.
            The second tab also has two input fields. The first is to input the 
            desired Mg/Kg dose. The second is to input the total gram weight of 
            the subjects you wish to receive that dose. Upon pressing the ‘Calculate
             Weights’ button, three outputs will be rendered to the screen. 
             1. ‘Dilution Volume (mL)’ which is the liquid solvent amount 
             necessary to dilute the drug into as milliliters. The rest of the 
             tab’s features and outputs are identical to its tab counterpart.

          <h3 class="pro-description">Description:</h3>
          <h3 class="pro-description">This Python Kivy app was created to assist 
            in correct coordinate calculations when performing stereotaxic brain 
            surgery on rodents. The application has three tabs, the tab chosen being 
            based on the number of stereotaxic targets the operator is aiming for. 
            The Unilateral tab is for a single target, the Bilateral tab is for two 
            targets, each equidistant and on either side of the brain, the third 
            tab is useful for two bilateral targets having four calculated targets 
            total. When doing stereotaxic brain surgery, the operator bases the 
            position of their targets from a location on the skull known as bregma. 
            Bregma is referenced in three-dimensional space by the three variables 
            AP (anterior/posterior), LM (lateral/medial), and DV (dorsal/ventral). 
            For each of these variables there is a distance from their bregma 
            location that is calculated to position an apparatus at a desired 
            location in the brain. The app takes the initial bregma variables as 
            well as their respective distance variables and performs their 
            calculations to display the color-coded target values to the user. 
            The target values are then simply dialed into the stereotaxic frame. 
            This eliminates hand calculation time as well as human error. 
            The app has several additional fields to facilitate record keeping. 
            These are ‘Subject’, ‘Experiment’, ‘Operator’, ‘Weight’, ‘Region’, and
            ‘Date’, there is also a ‘Reset’ button for the quick start of the next 
            subject or input errors.  All values are on screen and the operator 
            can screenshot the information for their records and reference.</h3>

      Experiment ID, Observer ID, and Subjects 1-4 IDs. A stopwatch style timer is 
      also available to track the progress and duration of the experimental trial. 
      This timer can be used to enter and reset the time for each subsequent 
      experimental trial. Under each Subject ID is a checkbox that is checked 
      indicating the Subject is freezing at that period of observation. 
      The program is set so that the Subjects are observed once every 10sec. 
      So, the output generated is percent time freezing per minute. 
      After each observation, the user presses the ‘Enter 10sec FZ Data’ button 
      to record data for that period and clear the check boxes in preparation 
      for the next observation. Text appears to inform the user at what time the next 
      observation should take place after each observation. Once the experimental trial has concluded 
      and all data is ready to be recorded, there is a ‘Unlock Submit Button’ 
      (created to prevent unintentional submission of data) button that enables 
      the ‘Submit Trial Data’ button that exports all data to the previously 
      created Excel file. Exported behavior measures are also divided into several 
      categories depending on the experimental parameters and is automated through 
      the program so the user can simply open the Excel file created through the 
      application and run the output data through the laboratory’s preferred 
      statistical testing software.</h3>
